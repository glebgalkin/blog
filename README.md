# Blogger Web Application

## Motivation
This project was build in order to get familiar with Spring Boot basic MVC model. 

<b>Model–view–controller (MVC)</b> is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

## Solution
The blogger web application allows users to create post and share their thoughts, stories and ideas.
